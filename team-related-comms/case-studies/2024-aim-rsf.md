## Case study for the position paper

The AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions (AIM) programme, funded in 2021, hosts seven consortia that span 28 different universities, 12 NHS trusts, as well as numerous charities, local government, public organisations healthcare providers from across the UK. The AIM’s Research Support Facility (RSF) plays a pivotal role in facilitating collaborative research within the AIM programme, focusing on five key themes: secure and interoperable infrastructure, research-ready data, open collaboration, public and patient involvement and engagement (PPIE), and sustainability and legacy. Working alongside a Programme Manager and a Research Project Manager, two RCMs provide community management across the  AIM program.

The RCMs’ roles are hosted under two core themes: Open Collaboration, dedicated to involving Early Career Researchers within the AIM program, and PPIE, dedicated to enhancing public and patient participation in AIM research. Their responsibilities encompass building and maintaining community infrastructure such as a GitHub organisation, delivering community events such as public seminars, and promoting specialised technical skills, including data standards, public engagement, reproducibility, and open science. Both RCMs have backgrounds in technical domains with varying levels of experience in community management. 

The PPIE RCM, Sophia Batchelor, brings expertise in human-centred design and participatory research approaches, while the Open Collaboration RCM, Eirini Zormpa, brought her experience in quantitative research and professional experience as a trainer in Research Data Management and open science. Senior Researchers, with expertise in community building, research engineering and citizen science practices respectively, offer strategic support and supervision for the RCMs, while the Programme Manager and Research Project Manager in the project are responsible for the operational and delivery priorities with the involvement and oversight from the project leaders.

Sophia developed a 'glossary of terms' to simplify technical concepts and hosted community calls, making it easier for the public to understand and integrate their perspectives into the research program. In Open Collaboration, Eirini delivered a series of training workshops introducing programming languages, open source and FAIR practices, and reproducibility techniques to enhance the skills of Early Career Researchers. Collaboratively, the RCMs adapted The Turing Way’s Collaboration Café, providing a platform for connection, knowledge exchange, and the adoption of standardised approaches in AIM projects.
