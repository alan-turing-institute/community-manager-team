The [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) programme at The Alan Turing Institute, under the leadership of Dr Kirstie Whitaker, represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives which seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all and to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts.

Led by Dr Malvika Sharan, TPS Senior Researcher for Open Research, TPS hosts the [Open Research Community Management](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) team with all Research Community Managers (RCMs) working across multiple teams, projects and programmes at the Institute.

All members of this team also participate in [*The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) -- an Open Source, Open Collaboration and Community-driven guide to data science, co-led by Kirstie (who is also the founder of the project) and Malvika.
Part of the Research Community Managers' role is to engage with and contribute to *The Turing Way* as TPS staff members of the project.

Members from within the Turing programmes working in similar positions, as well as members from projects collaborating with TPS/*The Turing Way* outside the Turing, referred to as "collaborators in community roles" in this document, are invited to join this team based on formal project or team-based collaboration.

Anyone interested in the work of this team from outside the Turing or non-collaborators is invited to collaborate with us on *The Turing Way*.
For further questions and information, please get in touch with Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).

## Background

Building communities in data science is crucial for bringing together diverse stakeholders, enabling knowledge exchange and co-creating a collaborative system in which AI research can thrive.​ At the Turing, this vision is realised by the integration of Research Community Managers (RCMs) in projects where multiple internal and external stakeholders are involved. As the visible and most connected members of the project, they apply Open Research and Community Management approaches to foster Communities of Practice in the Turing’s work.

> Research Community Managers empower the diverse stakeholders of a research community to co-create, maintain and sustain data science projects and outputs that they can equitably benefit from.

## RCMs at the Turing have the following goals

* Embed open, inclusive and reproducible research practices
* Ensure a shared understanding of goals, roadmap, processes
* Facilitate stakeholder engagement and collaboration
* Provide technical support and domain expertise
* Co-create, maintain and communicate project resources
* Amplify and champion community learnings and achievements

## About the Team

The TPS Research Programme hosts all RCMs within the **Open Research Community Management** team.
As community experts, each RCM is allocated to specific projects across different programs and as a team, they connect those projects as a joint-up system of open source and reproducible software, data, people and processes. 
By sharing knowledge as they develop in different projects, both in terms of scientific outcomes and socio-technical approaches applied to achieve them, RCMs break down the silos that traditionally exist in a research environment.

![the illustration shows three siloed groups of users, researchers and developers, who are connecting with each other based on commonly useful projects.](resources/images/community-managers.jpg)

RCMs combine a range of socio-technical skills including domain research expertise, scientific communications and stakeholder engagement approaches. 
Among others, their core responsibilities include ensuring access to skills and resources that different people and groups within the project need to meaningfully participate in and build something greater than the sum of its parts. 
Through collaboration, upskilling and resource development, they make implicit knowledge explicit so that everyone who wants to can get involved.
They provide information and processes for enabling members in our communities to move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project.
RCMs facilitate open and collaborative work of others, while often taking care of many background works needed to make tangible and visible work of their communities possible. 
They embed best practices for ensuring EDIA (Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility), collaboration, maintenance, acknowledgement and the impact of community-based work.
As a team, RCMs conduct research, build shared frameworks, create opportunities for skill-building and provide appropriate support systems for each other to exchange best practices from their work.

## Operationalising the Turing's Values in Community Management
 
- **Transparency**: Prioritise transparency and clarity in all our communications, collaborations and engagement pathways -- this is our responsibility and duty towards each other as peers and the communities we lead.
- **Leadership**: Apply open leadership practices in our community-building processes that encourage our community members to co-create additional knowledge and understanding, and apply that knowledge.
- **Inclusivity**: Embed equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) approaches in all our work and use community-based knowledge to improve the community or address the identified problem.
- **Respect**: Maintain respectful co-creation processes in the team and the communities by providing clear ways to participate, engage and lead through regular and ongoing opportunities.
- **Trust**: Build trust in the community by making implicit knowledge explicit and providing access to resources that enable everyone to discover, display and directly use their knowledge and skills.
- **Integrity**: Ensure ethical integrity through the involvement of community members, especially those impacted by our work.

## RCM Team's Guiding Principles

1. **Collaboration**: Actively break down silos by enabling knowledge exchange across all projects through collaboration and joint efforts.
1. **Communication**: Communicate openly about your project, communities the challenges you are seeking to address and solutions that have emerged.
1. **Professionalisation**: Uphold the highest personal and professional standards and share opportunities to co-create knowledge and infrastructure around community management and open research practices as a team.
1. **Open Leadership**: Apply open leadership to foster open spaces for community engagement and proactively find opportunities to collaborate with each other in extending the goals and impact of open Research Community Management at the institutional level.
1. **Peer support**: Create a supportive and non-judgmental environment to engage each other, celebrate successes, admit errors and draw learnings from each other's work.
1. **Dealing with Conflict**: Be willing to work through conflicts to resolution openly and constructively, as well as manage any relevant conflict of interest effectively.
1. **Principle of change**: Embrace the framework of change when responding to the needs of communities and stakeholders:
    * **Change is a fundamental** part of growth and effective change must come from within individuals and groups. 
    * Community engagement/growth **starts by first changing ourselves**, our attitudes, language and the way we view the world around us.
    * Communities are most successful when true partnerships exist and **power or control is delegated and vested effectively** within the community.

### Members and Collaborators

The **Open Research Community Management** team members, RCMs, are TPS researchers at the Turing who provide community management expertise in the Turing's teams, projects and programmes in the organisation.
As a core capability of the Turing, the RCM team supports the convening power of the Turing Institute across different interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder projects.
They also work closely with other core capabilities including the Research Application Management team, the Skills Team and the Research Engineering Group.

RCM team members apply open science and FAIR (Findable, accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices in the development, maintenance and sharing of community/research resources.
Many of the RCMs work on projects under the Health Programme or projects involving sensitive/confidential data, where they ensure and operationalise the principle of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary".

All resources developed to support/facilitate their work as RCMs and as experts from their respective projects will be shared via this repository (by removing any project-specific sensitive information).
Practices and case studies learned from their work will be shared in *The Turing Way* wherever possible.

The RCM team also hosts members with community-oriented roles currently collaborating with TPS or *The Turing Way*

New members are onboarded by the team lead and added as a contributor to this project repository.
Please [create an issue for your induction](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&template=NEW_MEMBERS.md&title=%5BINDUCTION%5D) (if not already created by the project lead).

If you are not already collaborating with TPS, but are interested in community management, please join *The Turing Way* community.

### Working with *The Turing Way*

All members of the Open Research Community Management team should take time to learn details in [*The Turing Way* core documents](./the-turing-way-core).
All community managers are onboarded as the core staff members of The *Turing Way* as part of their time is allocated to TPS and *The Turing Way*. 

Their engagement with *The Turing Way* project and community should help them understand how they can:
- enable reproducibility, open communication and ethical research in their projects and Communities of Practice they build.
- identify people, projects and resources that are crucial for the development, maintenance and sustainability of their projects.
- interconnect their work with other projects and communities in the wider landscape of data science and open research.
- facilitate openness, collaboration and transparent reporting, even when not all components of their projects can be made public.
- find support for their community work and in exchange support others' work, especially when it is closely aligned with their projects.
- enhance the technical understanding required in their work and share them more widely via *The Turing Way* (chapters, tutorials, templates or events).
