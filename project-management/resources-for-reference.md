# Resources for Reference

This document is a place to gather resources from specific projects we work on.
Use it to highlight resources you learn from, materials you have generated within your projects or anything you believe others in the team might find interesting.
Though we will primarily focus on open research, community building and topics that are relevant for working in a participatory space, you can share other technical and practical resources that you have found useful in your work.
