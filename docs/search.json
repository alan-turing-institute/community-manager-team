They collaborate closely with others and identify where they can surface implicit knowledge and make information explicitly available so that everyone who wants to can participate. Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches in data science projects, they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.\nTogether as a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike."

Building on the successes of the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme, Community Managers advance and scale the bidirectional flow of knowledge, resources and evidence for high-quality research within the Institute, as well as connect them across national and international data science communities. The aim is to empower Communities of Practice (CoP) at the Turing and more widely by granting them access to the skills and support they need to participate, collaborate and build something that is bigger than the sum of its part."
