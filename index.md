## Welcome to the Research Community Managers Wiki

Research Community Managers (RCMs) at the Turing invest in engaging, training and scaffolding agency within diverse groups of researchers, research engineers, programme management, and business team members by fostering diverse communities of practice. 

Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches in research projects, they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.

<!-- Together as a team, we work to ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike. -->

<!-- Members of Open Research Community Building team will ensure that research and data-driven AI solutions at the Turing use and build on open source tools, practices and systems by empowering people in the research community with open research skills. Building on the successes of the Tools, Practices and Systems research programme, Community Managers advance and scale the bidirectional flow of knowledge, resources and evidence for high-quality research within the Institute, as well as connect them across national and international data science communities. The aim is to empower Communities of Practice (CoP) at the Turing and more widely by granting them access to the skills and support they need to participate, collaborate and build something that is bigger than the sum of its part. -->
